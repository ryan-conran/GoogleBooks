## Google Books Search

## Motivation:  The motivation behind this app was to create a react based search and API call to reterive a list of books from the google books API.  Users would have the ability
to hit the save button on the page to save the book of their choosing to a database that would be handled vial mongo db.  

## Usage:  To use this app, users must simply direct themselves to the URL and type in the title of a book they wish to search for.  Once they click the search button, the user
will be given a list of books based off the title they entered in the search bar.  Users will be given the books title along with a photo of the book cover and book information.
Once mongo db is implemented, users can hit the save button beneath the books description to add that book to the database.  Users can see which books they saved when
database functionallity has been fully integrated.
